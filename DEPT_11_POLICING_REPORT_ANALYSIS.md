## Feature comparison

Based on the description it was suspected that some features may contain redundant data. The description for SUBJECT_RACE (DESCRIPTION) even stated that it is identical with the feature OOFICER_RACE (RACE_DESC).

The feature comparison results in following feature pairs being identical:

('INCIDENT_DATE', 'FIO_DATE') & ('INCIDENT_TIME', 'FIO_TIME')   \
('SUBJECT_RACE', 'DESCRIPTION') &  ('OFFICER_RACE', 'RACE_DESC')

The second feature (FIO_TIME and RACE_DESC) will be deleted.
