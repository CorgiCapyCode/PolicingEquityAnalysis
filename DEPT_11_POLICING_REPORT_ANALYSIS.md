## Feature and Data Pre-Filtering

Before starting a deeper analysis, the data will be pre-filtered by removing duplicants.
This is easy to implement and reduces some complexity.

### Redundant Features

Based on the description it was suspected that some features may contain redundant data. The description for SUBJECT_RACE (DESCRIPTION) even stated that it is identical with the feature OOFICER_RACE (RACE_DESC).

The feature comparison results in following feature pairs being identical:

('INCIDENT_DATE', 'FIO_DATE') & ('INCIDENT_TIME', 'FIO_TIME')    \
('SUBJECT_RACE', 'DESCRIPTION') &  ('OFFICER_RACE', 'RACE_DESC')

The second feature of both pairs (FIO_TIME and RACE_DESC) will be deleted.

### Duplicanted Data Points

The data points are checked for duplicants, while ignoring the first two columns, \
since they are unique identifiers (the first identifier is system generated and thus always different even for the the same case). \
By comparing all remaining 30 features, 2421 duplicants where found and removed from the dataset. \
The remaining number of data points is at this point: 149,809.

### Classification of remaining features

Numerical feature: quantitative feature
Ordinal feature: feature with a meaningful order
Nominal feature: feature without any order

### Feature value cleaning

#### Features with no changes
(INCIDENT_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER, SEQ_NUM)   \
(INCIDENT_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER.1, FIO_ID)  \
(LOCATION_DISTRICT, DIST)               \
(LOCATION_DISTRICT.1, DIST_ID)          \

(UNKNOWN_FIELD_TYPE, FIOFS_TYPE)        \
(UNKNOWN_FIELD_TYPE, TERRORISM)         \

(OFFICER_ASSIGNMENT, OFF_DIST_ID)       \
(OFFICER_ASSIGNMENT.1, OFF_DIST)        \
(LOCATION_STREET_NUMBER, STREET_ID)     \

#### Modified features
- (SUBJECT_GENDER, SEX)
    - Replace UNKNWON with NA-value
    - The sex of a subject should be known. It can be assumed that the entry is missing.
- (LOCATION_FULL_STREET_ADDRESS_OR_INTERSECTION, LOCATION)
    - Remove street numbers from intersections
    - Some intersections have street numbers included, while others not. Since the intersection already contains an exact location, the numbers will be removed.
    - Sort intersections alphabetically
    - Some intersections are written as STREET_A at STREET_B or STREET_B at STREET_A. Since this is the same location, the intersection streets will be sorted alphabetically.
- (INCIDENT_DATE, FIO_DATE)
    - Remove time
    - All entries have a time stamp of 00:00. So this information will be removed to reduce the complexity.
    - Clear unplausible dates.
    - The report states the data from 2011 to 2015. All other dates will be replaced with pd.NA (and later imputed)
- (SUBJECT_RACE, DESCRIPTION)
    - Replace NO DATA ENTERED with NA-value
    - Removed all ()
    - The item "UNKNWON" was kept, since it is possible that some subjects could not be categorized.
- (SUBJECT_DETAILS.1, CLOTHING)
    - Transform all to upper cases
    - Adjust color names (BLK = BLACK, WHT = WHITE, GRY = GREY, BLU = BLUE, GRN = GREEN, BRN = BROWN, DRK = DARK, WHTE = WHITE)
    - Adjust clothing names (JCK = JKT = JACKET, SHT = SHIRT, SWTSHT = SWEATSHIRT, JNS = JEANS, HOODY = HOODIE)
    - Adjust naming for T-Shirt (T SHIRT = T-SHIRT, TSHIRT = T-SHIRT)
    - Remove "."
    - Replace "/" with ", "
    - The column remains difficult to evalute. Specific characteristics can be extracted, such as in general "BLACK" clothes. Refining the feature more or using it as it is right now, does not make sense.
- (SUBJECT_DETAILS.2, COMPLEXION)
    - Remove NO DATA ENTERED
- (OFFICER_SUPERVISOR, SUPERVISOR_ID) & (OFFICER_ID, OFFICER_ID)
    - Remove all "1"
    - Since all other IDs are much larger numbers, it can be assumed that the 1 and 2 stand for "UNKNOWN"/"MISSING DATA" etc.
- (OFFICER_AGE, AGE_AT_FIO_CORRECTED)
    - The age range lies in between -1 and 243. A threshold will be set between 10 and 80.
- (LOCATION_CITY, CITY)
    - Remove NO DATA ENTERED values
- (OFFICER_ETHNICITY, ETHNICITY)
    - Data is partwise not interpretable.
- (INCIDENT_REASON.1, FIOFS_REASONS)
    - Replace "INVESTIGATE" with "INVESTIGATION"
    - Only take first category of reason (before ,)
    - Grouping different categories
- (INCIDENT_REASON, STOP_REASONS)
    - Replaced OTHER (SPECIFY) with OTHER

#### Vehicle related features
- The state is the only feature without missing entries (empty), but includes 99.456 NO DATA ENTERED and 10673 OTHER values.
- Some other vehicle related features show entries (e.g. "make" with 717 entries)
- The same applies for the other features, although occupant and model have no NO DATA ENTERED entries, but much more missing entries.
- As assumption:
    - Data points where all vehicle related features miss data (NO DATA ENTERED, 0, ""), including SEARCH not containing V or VP, no vehicle was involved. These fields will be filled with "NO VEHICLE INVOLVED".
    - Data points where at least one vehicle feature, will be counted as vehicle involved. Here the other missing features will be imputed later.
    - This assumption relates in 103273 entries where no vehicle was involved.
- VEH_MODEL receives further adjustments to the values.
    - Writting all in upper case and removing "." etc. reduced the unique values to around 1500.
    - The remaining differences are often based on a single entry (in the original unique entry list 90% of the values have less than 10 entries).
    - A further processing is not conducted for this project.

#### Dropping data points
For dropping data points a threshold of 30% is set. All data points having less than 30% non-NaN values will be dropped.
This applies to 0 data points. 


## Feature Filtering - 2nd iteration
Since there are currently two unique identifiers present, the second one will be dropped ((INCIDENT_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER.1, FIO_ID)).

Although the feature (LOCATION_FULL_STREET_ADDRESS_OR_INTERSECTION, LOCATION) contains slightly more information than (LOCATION_STREET_NUMBER, STREET_ID),  \
it will be dropped. After filtering it still contains around 33,000 unique values in contrast to the 3155 unique values from the street id.

The feature (VEHICLE_MODEL, VEH_MODEL) will be dropped as well, due to its high complexity. Although after processing it has less unique values than e.g. the date, \
there are still many variations fo writing. Furthermore it contains different depth of information.                                                                 \
E.g. some mention only the number of doors, while others add the type (Sedan etc.).                                                                                 \
Cleaning this feature is beyond the scope of this project.

Using the Chi^2 test for the feature numbers #4 and #5 as well as for #26 and #27 show that both pairs are highly correlated with each other.   \
The test results show that all 4 columns are highly related with each other (p-value ~0.0). Three of them will be dropped:                      \
(LOCATION_DISTRICT, DIST), (LOCATION_DISTRICT.1, DIST_ID), (OFFICER_ASSIGNMENT.1, OFF_DIST).

The feature (OFFICER_ETHNICITY, ETHNICITY) will be dropped, beacuse the data is not consistent and many abbriviations are not interpretable.

The feature (UNKNOWN_FIELD_TYPE, TERRORISM) will be dropped due to its very low rate of "yes", thus yielding almost no information.

After the 2nd iteration for feature filtering, 23 features remain in the dataset.
The new list of features including unique values is:

SPI: Simple Probalistic Imputer - Uses the probality distribution of the unique values to impute values.
CPI: Complex Probalistic Imputer - Uses the probability distribution of some unique values to impute values.
MBI: Multivariante Bayesian Imputer - Uses a Bayesian approach to impute the values based on the conditional probablity of another feature.
DI: Dependent Imputer - Uses values from other columns that ensure data correctness.

(SUBJECT_RACE, DESCRIPTION) & (SUBJECT_DETAILS.2, COMPLEXION) \
These two features deal with the subject itself. The probability of the subjects complexion is very likley to be dependet on the race and vice versa.

(OFFICER_SUPERVISOR, SUPERVISOR_ID) & (OFFICER_ASSIGNMENT, OFF_DIST_ID) \
The officer and supervisor IDs can be considered as related, since they are usually fixed.

(LOCATION_CITY, CITY)   \
The street IDs relate with the city.

All MBIs are followed by SPI to fill the remaining missing data.

## Feature Selection

The current data contains more than 5,500 unique values, mainly categorical data. Using a clustering algorithm that uses distance metrics would require one hot encoding. This leads to a very complex dataframe.
To reduce the complexity of this, the following table shows which actions will be done.


| Column Name                               | Number of Unique Values | Action              |

The columns with only two different unique values, do not need to be one hot encoded, since they are already of boolean nature. \
The feature ('SUBJECT_GENDER', 'SEX') label encoded. \
Further all unique values below 25 occurences will be grouped to "OTHER", to reduce complexity.
The age, year, month and day have been scaled using the min-max scaler.
